This project originated from an academic competition, based on LED Dot-matrix PWM control to adjust a variety of colors, with touch device and APP software, design and manufacture of intelligent tone modulation light system

## **Hardware**

The product consists of 4 √ó 7 LED to form the LED dot matrix, including MCU main control module, voltage regulator module, WiFi module, touch module.

## **Software**

A variety of images can be designed through the LED imaging principle. The output voltage duty cycle can be controlled by PWM to control the color and brightness of LED. The intelligent tone modulation light system can be realized with the key, touch wheel and touch slider

## **APP Development**

Based on the Tuya loT platform MCU SDK development cloud, so as to develop the 6 functions of the product, respectively, switch, brightness, breathing light, static, color, animation.
